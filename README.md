# JSON Schema Fuzz

This project aims to create randomized JSON files that conform to a 
user-defined JSON Schema. Although this 'fuzzer' is still in an early stage, 
the goal is to develop a tool for creating random data to be used for testing 
applications that recieve a high volume of JSON data.
